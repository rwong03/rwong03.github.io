In the Internet age, we are fortunate enough to have nearly instantaneous access to any resource we could ever want from any culture and in any language, whether it be books, news, research, comics, and of course, music. Music is different from all other media formats. Books, news, research, and comics generally incorporate some sort of text element . This means that someone who does not understand the language of the material will be unable to fully enjoy the content. Even when translated, a joke may not work in another language, or something may simply not convey properly without the full context of the language. In contrast, much like a painting, music can convey the message of other cultures -- not through visuals, but through audio. Growing up in a first-world country in the Internet age, I've never known a time where I haven't been able to listen to the music that I want to. I've never had to go to the record store to buy a track when all of the music I'd ever want to listen to is readily available on YouTube. I've even had the ability to have a computer curate music based on the music I listen to, through YouTube Music and Spotify . It's safe to say that music discovery has been made a lot easier with the advent of the Internet age. However, a thought occurs: being someone who has never had a life without the Internet, how were people able to share and discover music before the existence of the Internet ? This thought prompted another question: how does the music of other cultures get influenced by increasing globalization? Those questions are what this Capstone project aims to answer.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#globalization-in-music","text":"How was music shared before the rise of the Internet, and in what ways is it influenced by globalization?

Click here if the audio player does not work. In conclusion, before the Internet, music was shared through trade, colonization, and the invention of record players. It was then influenced by life events (such as slavery) and the desire of the people listening. Local trade occurred first with locals within the same continent. This can be found through Indigenous people in the Americas interacting with each other and through Chinese people trading with other cultures in the formative and international periods. International trade came next, with Europeans finding foreign lands and trading with the locals. These locals would get access to European instruments, which were more advanced than the improvised instruments that were usually made from animals. Colonization came next once Europeans decided they wanted to have more land. It was this era where the most change happened, as interaction between Europeans and indigenous peoples increased dramatically. At the same time, slavery occurred, which forced people from other countries to be slaves to rich people in richer countries. While conditions for slaves were obviously deplorable, it is undeniable that they had an effect on the globalization of music. The technology to record things came last, thereby dramatically increasing accessibility to music. Records allowed people to record and distribute music for a relatively low cost and without requiring a skilled musician and singer to play and/or sing the music. Music genres like the blues were created out of the depression and poverty that slavery had created in black Americans. Blues would later become jazz, which would be spread around the world by travellers on ships. Once music was able to be shared, it was able to be influenced because musicians would reinterpret music to fit local desires. Two examples of this were Shidaiqu and Japanese jazz. In the 1950s and 1960s, white Americans were getting more comfortable with \"black culture\" and music, which resulted in the continuation of music sharing between cultures. Once the Internet came into common use, it became incredibly easy for anyone to get music of any desired genre, allowing anyone to discover music that would have been difficult to find in an earlier era. This further increased the ability for different cultures to learn from one another.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"conclusion/#conclusion","text":"Your browser doesn't support embedded audio :( Click here This section includes a voiceover.

Fusion genres Babymetal, a Kawaii metal band. There are many examples of modern fusion of genres that one might not necessarily expect. A couple are listed below: \" Kawaii metal \" is a combination of J-Pop and metal. It first became popular in the 2010s, primarily in Japan but finding a small Western audience. \" Asian Underground \" is a combination of classical Indian instrumentals, Bollywood singing, and jazz. It first became popular in the 1990s, stemming from immigrants coming to the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Because Asian music has become more mainstream in part thanks to the Internet, the genre has mostly died down in favour of less 'underground' music. Popular foreign songs and groups BTS, a Korean boy band specializing in K-Pop. A number of foreign songs and groups have become incredibly popular in Western culture in the past few years. A few are listed below: Despacito by Luis Fonsi is a 2017 song in Spanish that currently has the second-highest number of views for a video on YouTube, with 7.33 billion. Yi Jian Mei (also known by its lyrics \"xue hua piao piao bei feng xiao xiao\") by Fei Yu-Ching is a 1983 song in Mandarin Chinese that gained notoriety on TikTok in 2020 because of how the song sounds \"stereotypically Chinese\". BTS is a Korean boy band that is well-known in English speaking countries thanks to the general increasing popularity of Korean pop music . In 2019, they collaborated in a song called Chicken Noodle Soup , which has three different languages spoken within the song -- English, Spanish, and Korean. The Internet The Internet has made it a lot easier to share information and music -- it's how you're viewing this website. Popular tracks can often be found on YouTube , while more 'indie' artists can be found on more music-centric platforms, like Soundcloud , Bandcamp , and Spotify . One can pretty easily conclude that people being able to listen to music at the click of a button will result in people listening to various types of music, which will lead to a change in how they play see music. How this connects to me A big part of this project is about self-introspection (as evidenced by its emphasis on learning logs and learning outcomes), and seeing how this topic connects to my own music experience is a good way to show learning. I've always personally been into music in some way -- I started playing piano from a relatively young age and started playing the alto saxophone as soon as I started having band classes. Usually, I play whatever is given to me -- in piano, it's usually classical music , and in band, it's usually generic band music . I have a tendency to mess around and play melodies of songs when I'm bored, which is often based on what I'm interested in. I've personally had a decent interest in Japanese pop music and video game music over the past few years, but thanks to quarantine, I've also taken an interest in some older Chinese pop music and current French pop music . I don't think that I would have the liberty had I not been born in the Internet age, as it would be that much more difficult to even be made aware of these other songs (or in the case of some video game music, impossible due to its lack of existence at the time). I haven't had much of an opportunity to actually mix these together to create something new because I'm not much of a composer. That being said, I still think that the music that I listen to (and on occasion, play) influences the way I look at music and the genres I like. Before 2014-ish, I'd probably be embarrassed listening to Japanese music because of its connotations with \"weeaboos\" -- people in the West with an obsession for Japan. These days, I can just embrace that I like what I like.","title":"8.

Three major factors will be shown below, followed by individual examples. Colonization itself Painting of Christopher Columbus arriving in the Americas. Colonization, in retrospect, was a pretty obvious point at which globalization occurred. I had not personally thought about it much (having focused primarily on the Internet), but it makes sense that people coming from Europe to stay in other countries would naturally bring their culture -- including music. An example of colonization affecting music is when in the 1800s, Indigenous communities develoepd marching bands and 'fiddle traditions' -- the former being an American creation and the latter presumably incorporating Indigenous melodies with European instruments. Slavery With colonization came slavery. Music often came from slaves who had been forced to come to other countries from Africa. Slaves would occasionally use music to send messages to other slaves without their owners knowing. It was also a way to make life more enjoyable (given how terrible life was for slaves). In many cases, instruments had to be improvised from objects like shipping crates. The depression and poverty left by the imprint of slavery would later create the musical genre of blues, which is a descendant of jazz. Christianization Christianization took place as Christian missionaries travelled the world in order to spread the word of God. Evidence of Christianization can be found in every cultural focus group: - Gospel music became important in black culture thanks to influenced \"spirituals\", with Christian music even becoming an entire subset of music categorized under \"black culture\". - Chirstianization occurred in the Indigenous peoples of the United States, where they \"began publishing their own hymnals for use in Christian worship\". - Portugese merchants and Roman Catholic priests travelled to Japan in the 16th century to spread the word of God. By the Meiji era, the three main influences of music were school, the military, and church. Records and Record Players The creation of the gramophone (record player) allowed music to be transported anywhere in the world using a disc. For example, F. W. Gaisberg's gramophone company created more than 1,700 recordings of \"native\" music in Asia in 1902. Individual Examples Li Jinhui, Shidaiqu , and Buck Clayton Li Jinhui, known as the \"father of Chinese popular music\", was a Chinese artist who created a new genre known as \"Shidaiqu\" -- a combination of Chinese folk music and jazz. While the instrumentation ressembled an Americna jazz orchestra, it made use of scales generally associated with Asian music. His music was generally considered popular in China, but both the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) tried to ban it. He was eventually killed during the Cultural Revolution in the mid 1960s. \u6bdb\u6bdb\u96e8, by Li Jinhui. Notice the use of saxophones -- a traditionally 'jazzy' instrument. Buck Clayton was a black American who travelled to Shanghai in 1935, describing his time there as the \"happiest two years\" of his life\" due to the respect that the Chinese people gave to him (compared to the recognition and respect that had been denied in the United States because of the colour of his skin). Japanese Jazz Japanese Jazz began its existence after bands from the US and the Phillipines visited Japan, with the first native Japanese jazz band being the Hatano Jazz Band in 1912. The genre was considered somewhat controversial for not being natively Japanese. In the 1930s, the composers Ryoichi Hattori and Koichi Sugii attempted to make the genre less controversial by combining jazz with traditional Japanese works. A good example of this can be found below:","title":"7.

Music can be divided into four periods: the formative period (3000 BC to 300 AD), the international period (300 to 800 AD), the national period (800 to 1800 AD), and the 'world music' period (1800 AD onwards). The Formative Period 3000 BC to 300 AD The formative period is considered to be the symbolic birth of music. While little remains from the formative period, some evidence of music continues to exist (hence the period existing), including vessel flutes, drums, bells, and some written records from the Zhou dynasty (1045 BC to 256 BC) in the form of famous books known as the Five Classics . Music was sometimes connected with the five elements known at the time -- earth, wood, metal, fire, and water. During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), foreign influences began to appear in China in the form of banquet music and ritual music. At the turn of the millennium, Buddhism had entered China from India. Many goods, presumably including musical instruments, had started to be traded through the desert trade routes. The International Period 300 AD to 800 AD The international period emphasized trade cities and harbours, with foreign goods and ideas coming from Persians, Arabs, Indians, and Malaysians. Music was officially recognized bureaucratically by the government in the form of court music, common music, and foreign music . This internationalism would be unmatched until 1100 years later in the mid-20th century. The National Period 800 AD to 1800 AD The goal during this period was to culturally appear Chinese rather than to appear foreign, in direct contrast to the International Period that preceded it, creating many uniquely Chinese genres such as Kunqu and Jingxi (Chinese music-drama). The World Music Period 1800 AD to present During this period, western instruments, such as saxophones, were combined with Chinese fiddles and percussion, with well-known Western music occasionally being mixed with opera melodies (for example, the popular Flight of the Bumble Bee). In the 20th century, China became a communist country. This created musical influence in the form of songs praising the leader of the communist party -- at the time, Mao Zedong. The current national anthem of China, \"March of the Volunteers\", was a mixture of new and traditional Chinese music. These days, music can be found all over China (despite censorship on the Internet), with Euro-American music becoming a part of China's urban culture. History of Japanese Music Some of Japan's music came from China, with the first evidence of its existence being in the form of bronze bells from 300 BC, presumably brought by tribes migrating from northern Asia. Documented history of music in Japan dates back to 800 AD -- a full 100 years older than the documented history in the West. Music was often distributed orally, similar to jazz. Christian missionaries who visited Japan in the mid-16th century introduced Christian music as well as Western musical instruments, such as the double-reed shawm. During the Meiji era, Westernization had taken place, mainly influencing music in church, school and the military. Japan's national anthem, Kimi ga yo , was created in the style of Meiji modernism. The song itself was performed by English, French, and German bandmasters and combined Western and Japanese traditions.","title":"4.

Many goods, presumably including musical instruments, had started to be traded through the desert trade routes.","title":"The Formative Period"},{"location":"history/asia/#the-international-period","text":"300 AD to 800 AD The international period emphasized trade cities and harbours, with foreign goods and ideas coming from Persians, Arabs, Indians, and Malaysians.

In the 20th century, China became a communist country. This created musical influence in the form of songs praising the leader of the communist party -- at the time, Mao Zedong. The current national anthem of China, \"March of the Volunteers\", was a mixture of new and traditional Chinese music. These days, music can be found all over China (despite censorship on the Internet), with Euro-American music becoming a part of China's urban culture.","title":"The World Music Period"},{"location":"history/asia/#history-of-japanese-music","text":"Some of Japan's music came from China, with the first evidence of its existence being in the form of bronze bells from 300 BC, presumably brought by tribes migrating from northern Asia. Documented history of music in Japan dates back to 800 AD -- a full 100 years older than the documented history in the West. Music was often distributed orally, similar to jazz. Christian missionaries who visited Japan in the mid-16th century introduced Christian music as well as Western musical instruments, such as the double-reed shawm. During the Meiji era, Westernization had taken place, mainly influencing music in church, school and the military. Japan's national anthem, Kimi ga yo , was created in the style of Meiji modernism. The song itself was performed by English, French, and German bandmasters and combined Western and Japanese traditions.","title":"History of Japanese Music"},{"location":"history/indigenous/","text":"History of Indigenous American music NOTE: The contents of this page relate to the Indigenous music of those who lived in North America before it was colonized. Music in the Americas dates back to the Inca and Aztecs. The Aztecs in particularly carved pictures onto primitive instruments to indicate how, when, where, and who would play them. Different societies weren't isolated from one another -- trade occasionally occurred. During these interactions, music was sometimes shared, with the sharing of music \"extending from Florida to Ontario\".

Discovery by Europeans Early European travellers, searching for new land, landed in North America in the 15th and 16th centuries. One of the first to document music was Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo (1492-1584). Thinking they were from a superior, 'more civilized' society, People in this era tended to express prejudice when describing Indigenous music. Unfortunately, this is still somewhat true in 2020 -- certain musical genres are associated with the poor, disadvantaged, and/or oppressed. Pictured: Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo. Between 1500 and 1700, Indigenous peoples began to trade with the newly arriving European settlers. These settlers brought musical instruments from their homeland and taught the Indigenous peoples how to play them. This would ultimately have a lasting impact on the music they played, having exchanged their \"primitive\" music for \"modern European\" ones. European Influence From the 1800s and onwards, Indigenous communities began to develop music from genres that may appear more familiar to us today: hymns, marking bands, and \"fiddle traditions\". One may note that these genres appear to be Christian in nature -- this is due to the Christianization that was pushed to the Indigenous peoples, similar to what happened with African-American music. Music in the Pacific Northwest Indigenous music in the Pacific Northwest region (comprised of what is now British Columbia, Washington State, and Oregon) tended to share some 'general traits' with South American music. It is also linked with some traits found in music from the Eskimo as well as the Paleo-Siberians, found in Asia. The earliest account of music in the Pacific Northwest comes from Captain Cook, who had visited Nookta Sound (on the west coast of what is now Vancouver Island) in 1778. He stated that the music of the Pacific Northwest \"bear[ed] no little resemblance to those performed by the New Zealanders\" and that the implements of music, \"if such they may be called\" ... a \"small pea-whistle about an inch long which they put wholly into the mouth\". A later account from James G. Swan in 1869 referred to those in the Pacific Northwest as \"good imitators\" learning the songs of white men and of \"negro melodies\". Music Documentation Several books were published in an effort to document Indigenous music. One of the first of these books was Indian Melodies , published in 1845 by Narragansett composer Thomas Commuck . Such books were often published in English and occasionally the native language of the community (which occasionally did not have a writing system).

It relied primarily on documenting oral tradition -- similar to African drumming circles. The 20th Century In the early 1900s, a new genre of music based on the traditions of Indigenous people in North America was born -- powwow , a celebration music and dance. The word itself comes from the Algonquian language, where it refers to traditional healing rituals.

By the 1960s, Indigenous musicians were participating in many genres that we know today, including jazz, rock and roll, country, hip-hop, rap, and reggae. A modern example of a song by Indigenous artists is the song \"The Warriors\" by Snotty Nose Rez Kids.

As such, this section will primarily deal with the history of popular music ('pop music') from an American perspective. The Beginnings of Pop Music Image of Thomas Edison with his second phonograph. Photographed by Levin Corbin Handy in 1878. Popular music first began in the 19th century with the consumer availability of devices that were able to record and play sound (the phonograph by Thomas Edison and the gramophone by Emile Berliner, later known as a record player). Emile Berliner created a company that would create discs and encouraged popular singers at the time (Enrico Caruso and Dame Nellie Melba) to record music on his system. Copyright laws needed to adjust to the new medium, so they were strengthened in the late 19th century, allowing composers, singers, and publishers to earn money through music production. The main contrast between popular music and classical music is that classical music in its later years tended to focus on being different and/or practicing individuality, while popular music catered to whatever was popular in the middle class (hence the name). Tin Pan Alley Image of buildings in Tin Pan Alley. The Tin Pan Alley was an area of New York that is said to have been started in roughly 1885, allegedly named because of the sheer number of pianos playing at once in the area would result in a sound resembling a large number of people banging on tin pans. This area dominated the popular music scene in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because audio quality at the time was awful, this alley often created popular music in the form of sheet music that amateur musicians could reproduce. Tin Pan Alley was superseded once audio quality became bearable and other mediums of music took precedence. It is disputed when this exactly took place, with common dates being the 1930s and the 1950s The 1920s and 1930s With the 1920s, electrical recording had gotten more and more popular, as well as radio -- distribution of music, news, and entertainment right from the comfort of your own home. Sheet music began to become less popular. By the mid 1920s, electrical recording drastically improved, making electronic records popular and causing the plummet of sheet music sales. Likewise, the popularity of radio caused the sales of gramophone records to decrease, threatening the recording industry (which was feeling all music at the time). License fees were enforced on broadcasters in order to ensure the continued existence of the recording industry. In the 1930s, jazz, initially established in New Orleans, began to become popular. These musicians played at illegal speakeasies during the Prohibition era, where alcohol was entirely disallowed. The Golden Age of Radio Image of a radio from the 1920s.. The Golden Age of Radio took place between 1920s to 1950s. Exponential growth was occurring -- in 1921, five radio stations; in 1925, over 600. Radio broadcasting allowed for small, rural towns to get information from the urban city centres. These rural radio stations would broadcast local music genres that would gain popularity in other parts of the country. The 1940s and 1950s An advertisement for \"race records\" from a record store in New York. 1928. Further technological advances took place in the 1940s, such as the creation of the first tape recorders. This technology would become more popular in the 1960s, with multiple-track recording becoming possible (allowing musicians to record their parts individually and to combine them, rather than forcing all musicians to play together at the same time in a physical room). While music had previously been targeted towards only adults, some music -- particularly that of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald -- become popular with a new market: teenagers. In the 1950s, television began its widespread adoption, in part thanks to the improvement of technology. This would threaten the radio industry, which until then had been the main source for entertainment in the home. From this point, the radio industry began focussing more of its resources on music, joining forces with the recording industry in an effort to survive. Radio would become a greater means of promotion, which at times would be influenced by race. A practice known as payola became popular, where a radio station would broadcast a specific song in exchange for payment from a record company. Urban Chicago Blues, or \"Rhythm and Blues\" (R B), became popular in the 1950s with teenagers, both white and black. It was classified as \"race music\" in record stores, with its sales segregated from the \"white music records\" on the pop charts as well as being banned from some radio stations. Music and Civil Rights Around the 1950s and 1960s, segregation laws began to be repealed and aspects of black culture began to be more accepted by white people. Things would change when a white man began to sing songs written by black people: Elvis Presley. Presley made music written by black people more acceptable to the mainstream white audiences, popularizing the rock and roll genre. He also popularized rockabilly, which was a blend of rock and country music. The 1960s Until this point, we have neglected to talk about music on the European continent. While American artists would occasionally chart in Europe, very few Europeans would ever achieve success in the United States. The most obvious example of European success is the Beatles, originating from the United Kingdom. The Beatles became incredibly popular in the United States, even appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show and gaining the largest audience of any American television program at the time (a third of the population, or 74 million people). At the same time, more genres began to combine, with the combination of R B, pop, gospel, and blues creating soul music, which described the lives of black Americans. Folk music also began to gain traction, talking about social issues lie civil rights, feminism, and the environment. The 1970s and 1980s Picture of David Bowie, a glam rock artist. In the 1970s, more political activism took place in the form of music. A new genre, known as \"glam rock\", combined hard rock and pop. While it was primarily a British phenomenon, it became popular in the United States in Canada, with artists like David Bowie and Elton John. Disco also became popular with bands like KC and the Sunshine Band and the Bee Gees. In the 1980s, Black American youths got more into the music scene, getting into genres like hip-hop and rap. These genres came off as more casual and focused on the concerns of the \"general population\" rather than the upper and upper middle classes. Political and social commentary in the form of music continued. The 1990s and 2000s In this era, hip-hop and rock were expanded on with popular artists still well-known today such as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Pop music began to explicitly target teenagers, with artists like Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, and Spice Girls. In the 21st century, some artists gained notoriety through MySpace, like Nicki Minaj, Owl City, and Katy Perry.

Click here if the audio player does not work. Suffice it to say, I've learned a lot about how I learn over this past year of Capstone. Truthfully, my initial research ended up being not totally relevant to my inquiry question. I went too deep into the \"background research\", severely limiting my ability to find decent examples of globalization to answer my inquiry question. I ended up learning a lot of information about music that I did not know before, having conducted so much background research. Most of my knowledge in music had been from RCM History examinations and courses (which focused on European history) and from passing knowledge. Because of the background research I did, I learned a little bit of everything from the four focus areas that I initially set for myself. In terms of strategies, I've learned better ways to research. In the beginning of the project, I relied primarily on the Britannica and other encyclopedic sources to an undesirable extent, with basically all of my information coming from some sort of encyclopedia for about three months. I was later given advice on Google Scholar and found it to be a much better source for information, especially when I stopped doing background research and started actually working towards my inquiry question. I'm still curious about other examples of globalization. While I've definitely found some examples from doing this project, I know for sure that there are more out there. My shortfalls from doing too much background research and from initially not using proper research methods meant that I was not able to find evidence to the best of my ability. To anyone doing a Capstone project in the future, my advice to them would be to set proper deadlines . I rushed my \"Capstone calendar\" and didn't take it seriously in an effort to get it before an arbitrary due date. This would spiral into a disorganized mess that made my project a lot harder than it needed to be. As far as advice for doing this type of project goes, my advice would be to not do one unless it is the only way that your topic works. It is better to find some other creative method (like creating music, creating software, doing interviews, etc.) to present your learning than it is to present information as if you were writing a persuasive essay for your inquiry question. Doing a long research project makes every step of the process slow -- research, analysis and production alike.","title":"What I Learned"},{"location":"info/learned/#what-ive-learned","text":"Your browser doesn't support embedded audio :( Click here This section includes a voiceover.

Click here if the audio player does not work. I've always been into music since I was a kid. Like many kids with my cultural background, my parents got me into music lessons (in my case, piano) from a young age. From there, I found myself naturally attracted to band, enjoying the idea of multiple people making sound together to produce something greater. This interest would last through all of high school -- hence why I've taken a band course as an elective every year. I feel that my inquiry is important because globalization is an important topic right now. Everyone is isolated, both from the pandemic and from racial tension from recent events, such as use of excessive force by police in the United States and the anti-Asian hate crimes that have propgated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite all this racial tension, music is still something that connects us all, regardless of race, colour, or creed. In essence, my message is that everyone should respect each other -- and music is a nice way to show that. To create my product, I first picked some key focus areas, as I knew it would be impossible to cover every single culture. I ended up deciding on African culture, Indigenous American culture, Asian/Chinese culture, and Western culture -- African culture because of its connections with racial tension in the United States today, Indigenous Americans because of the importance of reconciliation efforts, Chinese culture because of its connections to myself (despite being born in Canada), and Western culture because of it being the society that we live in today. From there, I tried to find examples of people that merged different genres. When this proved difficult, I moved to finding examples of 'fusion' genres. After that, I compiled all of my information together (adding additional information when I found it necessary) and created a conclusion from it. My biggest roadblock has been my inconsistency. I have a tendency to miss deadlines and to not find motivation until the very last moment. I eventually persevered by working in the library to ensure better concentration and discipline at home -- while it wasn't completely successful, it was sufficiently successful for me to get the project done.","title":"Learning Process"},{"location":"info/lproc/#my-learning-process","text":"Your browser doesn't support embedded audio :( Click here This section includes a voiceover.
