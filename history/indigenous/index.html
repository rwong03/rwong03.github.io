<h1 id="history-of-indigenous-american-music">History of Indigenous American music</h1>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:darkred"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> The contents of this page relate to the Indigenous music of those who lived in <strong>North America</strong> before it was colonized.</p>
<hr />
<p>Music in the Americas dates back to the Inca and Aztecs. The Aztecs in particularly carved pictures onto primitive instruments to indicate how, when, where, and who would play them.</p>
<p>Different societies weren't isolated from one another -- trade occasionally occurred. During these interactions, music was sometimes shared, with the sharing of music "extending from Florida to Ontario". </p>
<p>Instruments (primarily <em>membranophones</em>, or drums, and <em>idiophones</em>, or rattles and clappers) were made using natural resources in the area, such as animal horns, gourds, animal hides, and carved wood. Hand-carved wooden flutes and whistles, while less common than drums, were also used in some cases. However, the human voice was used the most.</p>
<h2 id="discovery-by-europeans">Discovery by Europeans</h2>
<p>Early European travellers, searching for new land, landed in North America in the 15th and 16th centuries. One of the first to document music was <strong>Bernal Díaz del Castillo</strong> (1492-1584). Thinking they were from a superior, 'more civilized' society, People in this era tended to express prejudice when describing Indigenous music. Unfortunately, this is still somewhat true in 2020 -- certain musical genres are associated with the poor, disadvantaged, and/or oppressed.</p>
<p><center><a href="/resources/006-indigenous-bernal.jpg"><img alt="Image: Bernal Díaz del Castillo" src="/resources/006-indigenous-bernal.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>Pictured: Bernal Díaz del Castillo.</em></center></p>
<p>Between 1500 and 1700, Indigenous peoples began to trade with the newly arriving European settlers. These settlers brought musical instruments from their homeland and taught the Indigenous peoples how to play them. This would ultimately have a lasting impact on the music they played, having exchanged their "primitive" music for "modern European" ones.</p>
<h2 id="european-influence">European Influence</h2>
<p>From the 1800s and onwards, Indigenous communities began to develop music from genres that may appear more familiar to us today: hymns, marking bands, and "fiddle traditions". One may note that these genres appear to be Christian in nature -- this is due to the Christianization that was pushed to the Indigenous peoples, similar to what happened with African-American music.</p>
<h2 id="music-in-the-pacific-northwest">Music in the Pacific Northwest</h2>
<p>Indigenous music in the Pacific Northwest region (comprised of what is now British Columbia, Washington State, and Oregon) tended to share some 'general traits' with South American music. It is also linked with some traits found in music from the Eskimo as well as the Paleo-Siberians, found in Asia.</p>
<p>The earliest account of music in the Pacific Northwest comes from Captain Cook, who had visited Nookta Sound (on the west coast of what is now Vancouver Island) in 1778. He stated that the music of the Pacific Northwest "bear[ed] no little resemblance to those performed by the New Zealanders" and that the implements of music, "if such they may be called" ... a "small pea-whistle about an inch long which they put wholly into the mouth".</p>
<p>A later account from James G. Swan in 1869 referred to those in the Pacific Northwest as "good imitators" learning the songs of white men and of "negro melodies".</p>
<h2 id="music-documentation">Music Documentation</h2>
<p>Several books were published in an effort to document Indigenous music. One of the first of these books was <em>Indian Melodies</em>, published in 1845 by <em>Narragansett</em> composer <strong>Thomas Commuck</strong>. Such books were often published in English and occasionally the native language of the community (which occasionally did not have a writing system).

</center></p>
<p>Another book that was published to document indigenous music was a hymnal (hymn book) published by the Cherokee tribe in 1821. It relied primarily on documenting oral tradition -- similar to African drumming circles.</p>
<h2 id="the-20th-century">The 20th Century</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, a new genre of music based on the traditions of Indigenous people in North America was born -- <em>powwow</em>, a celebration music and dance. The word itself comes from the <em>Algonquian</em> language, where it refers to traditional healing rituals. While this word has been used by some to refer to any social gathering, it is considered culturally insensitive to do so.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, Indigenous musicians were participating in many genres that we know today, including jazz, rock and roll, country, hip-hop, rap, and reggae.</p>
<p>A modern example of a song by Indigenous artists is the song "The Warriors" by Snotty Nose Rez Kids. It is a hip-hop/rap song that protests against building a pipeline on indigenous territory.</p>
