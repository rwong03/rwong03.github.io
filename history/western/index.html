<h1 id="history-of-western-popular-music">History of Western Popular Music</h1>
<p>While music in the "Old World" dates back to 3500 BCE (with rudimentary instruments being created by ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians), not much of it is actually relevant to this project. As such, this section will primarily deal with the history of popular music ('pop music') from an American perspective.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginnings-of-pop-music">The Beginnings of Pop Music</h2>
<p><center><a href="/resources/007-western-phonograph.jpg"><img alt="Image of a phonograph" src="/resources/007-western-phonograph.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>Image of Thomas Edison with his second phonograph. Photographed by Levin Corbin Handy in 1878.</em></a></center></p>
<p>Popular music first began in the 19th century with the consumer availability of devices that were able to record and play sound (the phonograph by Thomas Edison and the gramophone by Emile Berliner, later known as a record player). Emile Berliner created a company that would create discs and encouraged popular singers at the time (Enrico Caruso and Dame Nellie Melba) to record music on his system. </p>
<p>Copyright laws needed to adjust to the new medium, so they were strengthened in the late 19th century, allowing composers, singers, and publishers to earn money through music production.</p>
<p>The main contrast between popular music and classical music is that classical music in its later years tended to focus on being different and/or practicing individuality, while popular music catered to whatever was popular in the middle class (hence the name).</p>
<h2 id="tin-pan-alley">Tin Pan Alley</h2>
<p><center><a href="/resources/008-western-tinpan.jpg"><img alt="Image of Tin Pan Alley buildings" src="/resources/008-western-tinpan.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>Image of buildings in Tin Pan Alley.</em></a></center></p>
<p>The <em>Tin Pan Alley</em> was an area of New York that is said to have been started in roughly 1885, allegedly named because of the sheer number of pianos playing at once in the area would result in a sound resembling a large number of people banging on tin pans. This area dominated the popular music scene in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Because audio quality at the time was awful, this alley often created popular music in the form of sheet music that amateur musicians could reproduce. </p>
<p>Tin Pan Alley was superseded once audio quality became bearable and other mediums of music took precedence. It is disputed when this exactly took place, with common dates being the 1930s and the 1950s</p>
<h2 id="the-1920s-and-1930s">The 1920s and 1930s</h2>
<p>With the 1920s, electrical recording had gotten more and more popular, as well as radio -- distribution of music, news, and entertainment right from the comfort of your own home. Sheet music began to become less popular.</p>
<p>By the mid 1920s, electrical recording drastically improved, making electronic records popular and causing the plummet of sheet music sales. Likewise, the popularity of radio caused the sales of gramophone records to decrease, threatening the recording industry (which was feeling all music at the time). License fees were enforced on broadcasters in order to ensure the continued existence of the recording industry.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, jazz, initially established in New Orleans, began to become popular. These musicians played at illegal speakeasies during the Prohibition era, where alcohol was entirely disallowed.</p>
<h2 id="the-golden-age-of-radio">The Golden Age of Radio</h2>
<p><center><a href="/resources/009-western-radio.jpg"><img alt="Image of a radio from the 1920s" src="/resources/009-western-radio.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>Image of a radio from the 1920s..</em></a></center></p>
<p>The Golden Age of Radio took place between 1920s to 1950s. Exponential growth was occurring -- in 1921, five radio stations; in 1925, over 600. Radio broadcasting allowed for small, rural towns to get information from the urban city centres. These rural radio stations would broadcast local music genres that would gain popularity in other parts of the country.</p>
<h2 id="the-1940s-and-1950s">The 1940s and 1950s</h2>
<p><center><a href="/resources/010-western-racerecord.jpg"><img alt="Advertisement for race records" src="/resources/010-western-racerecord.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>An advertisement for "race records" from a record store in New York. 1928.</em></a></center></p>
<p>Further technological advances took place in the 1940s, such as the creation of the first tape recorders. This technology would become more popular in the 1960s, with multiple-track recording becoming possible (allowing musicians to record their parts individually and to combine them, rather than forcing all musicians to play together at the same time in a physical room). </p>
<p>While music had previously been targeted towards only adults, some music -- particularly that of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald -- become popular with a new market: teenagers.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, television began its widespread adoption, in part thanks to the improvement of technology. This would threaten the radio industry, which until then had been the main source for entertainment in the home. From this point, the radio industry began focussing more of its resources on music, joining forces with the recording industry in an effort to survive. Radio would become a greater means of promotion, which at times would be influenced by race. A practice known as <em>payola</em> became popular, where a radio station would broadcast a specific song in exchange for payment from a record company. </p>
<p>Urban Chicago Blues, or "Rhythm and Blues" (R&amp;B), became popular in the 1950s with teenagers, both white and black. It was classified as "race music" in record stores, with its sales segregated from the "white music records" on the pop charts as well as being banned from some radio stations.</p>
<h2 id="music-and-civil-rights">Music and Civil Rights</h2>
<p>Around the 1950s and 1960s, segregation laws began to be repealed and aspects of black culture began to be more accepted by white people. Things would change when a white man began to sing songs written by black people: Elvis Presley.</p>
<p>Presley made music written by black people more acceptable to the mainstream white audiences, popularizing the rock and roll genre. He also popularized rockabilly, which was a blend of rock and country music. </p>
<h2 id="the-1960s">The 1960s</h2>
<p>Until this point, we have neglected to talk about music on the European continent. While American artists would occasionally chart in Europe, very few Europeans would ever achieve success in the United States. The most obvious example of European success is the Beatles, originating from the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Beatles became incredibly popular in the United States, even appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show and gaining the largest audience of any American television program at the time (a third of the population, or 74 million people).</p>
<p>At the same time, more genres began to combine, with the combination of R&amp;B, pop, gospel, and blues creating soul music, which described the lives of black Americans. Folk music also began to gain traction, talking about social issues lie civil rights, feminism, and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-1970s-and-1980s">The 1970s and 1980s</h2>
<p><center><a href="/resources/011-western-davidbowie.jpg"><img alt="Picture of David Bowie, glam rock" src="/resources/011-western-davidbowie.jpg" /></a><br>
<em>Picture of David Bowie, a glam rock artist.</em></a></center></p>
<p>In the 1970s, more political activism took place in the form of music. A new genre, known as "glam rock", combined hard rock and pop. While it was primarily a British phenomenon, it became popular in the United States in Canada, with artists like David Bowie and Elton John. Disco also became popular with bands like KC and the Sunshine Band and the Bee Gees.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Black American youths got more into the music scene, getting into genres like hip-hop and rap. These genres came off as more casual and focused on the concerns of the "general population" rather than the upper and upper middle classes. Political and social commentary in the form of music continued.</p>
<h2 id="the-1990s-and-2000s">The 1990s and 2000s</h2>
<p>In this era, hip-hop and rock were expanded on with popular artists still well-known today such as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Pop music began to explicitly target teenagers, with artists like Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, and Spice Girls.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, some artists gained notoriety through MySpace, like Nicki Minaj, Owl City, and Katy Perry. Artists were now able to "go viral" through video sharing sites like YouTube -- for example, One Pound Fish:</p>
